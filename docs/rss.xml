I guess I approach the field from the angle of my Mathematics background, as I see it as a universal language between machines, arts, and possibly nature. As a projection of that language, I find the OpenGL Shading Language an interesting case, at the intersection of computing and visual arts, that's concise and expressive enough to demonstrate human creativity and ingenuity. Since I built my Kubernetes cluster with Rapsberry Pi a year ago, I've kept somewhere in a corner of my head, the idea I could use the touchscreen monitor to play with OpenGL, making the coolest cluster ever, to begin with ðŸ˜Ž, and possibly turning it into a small gaming device ðŸ•¹ðŸ‘¾.

As a software engineer, I either use a local single-node Kubernetes cluster, or a remote multi-node cluster, to test my work on a daily basis. I wanted to have the benefits of both, that is being able to use a multi-node cluster, without any of the latencies you can experience while working with a remote environment.
