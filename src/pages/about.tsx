        <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi!</p>
        <p>
          My name is <i>Antonin Stefanutti</i>. I work as a <i>minimal</i> software engineer, that
          goes by the <i>Principles of Evolutionary Architecture</i>. I studied{' '}
          <i>Applied Mathematics</i>, and has always find <i>beauty</i> in the effectiveness of its
          abstractions and the conciseness of its symbolic notation. I tend to approach software
          engineering from the angle of my mathematical background, and try to balance the{' '}
          <i>perfectionism</i> that comes with it, with the reality of contemporary{' '}
          <i>productivism</i>. From time to time, I find myself enjoying a brief moment of{' '}
          <i>plenitude</i>, as I write code and think I've achieved that level of <i>beauty</i>.
